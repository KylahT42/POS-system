Purpose of Code:
The following features are built into this Point-of-Sale (POS) system to handle retail transactions: 
•	Monitoring the inventory of products and managing shopping carts 
•	Sales tax computations
•	Applications for discount
•	 Generating receipts and sending out low-stock notifications

How to Run Program:
1.First, requirements installed Python.
2.Save the code as a 'py' file.
3. Execute using the command prompt or terminal: python pos_system.py
4. Adhere to menu instructions (1–5) to:
   -Add or remove items
   -View cart
   -View low stock
   -The checkout process
   -View Product list
   -Exit system		
   
Required Modifications:
1. Add current inventory to product catalog lines 1–10. 
2. Modify the tax rate (line 65) to reflect local conditions. 
3. Adjust the discount thresholds (line 68) as necessary. 
4. Add the company name to the receipt heading (line 91). 
5. Modify line 101's low-stock criteria to reflect inventory requirements. NEEDED. 

Limitations and assumptions:
-The product names are case-insensitive. Lack of database permanence and insensitivity when the application ends, the data is reset.
-The format is in single currency (USD); the maximum discount for large purchases (>$5000) is 5%.
- Only integer amounts (no fractional items)
-Lack of a user authentication system; simple error correction for incorrect inputs
- One terminal only (no support for multiple users)
